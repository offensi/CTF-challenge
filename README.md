# CTF-challenge - CTF players and bughunters united!

## Introduction
Bug bounty hunting and playing CTF games are 2 distinct things. CTF players are known for their incredible in depth knowledge on very specific topics. Bug bounty hunters are known for their patience in doing recon. Most CTF players however dislike doing recon and bug bounty hunters sometimes miss the expertise to solve the last piece of a puzzle that's needed in order to complete a full blown exploit chain. 

## The Idea
If we as bug bounty hunters present small chunks of work in the form of a CTF challenge, we might be able to bridge the gap between CTF players and bug bounty hunters. The CTF player would not have to waste time on doing recon and the bug bounty hunter gets an extra helping hand in solving the last piece of a puzzle. Both the CTF player and the bug bounty hunter could profit from bounties that would normally be out of reach for them. The company/target would benefit by the higher quality level of reports they receive. 

## The Objective

In this repository you find a golang binary named 'victim-binary'. This is a custom webserver that plays a major role in a target i have been working on. If authentication can be bypassed on this webserver, we can complete a full exploit chain and submit a report. 

## Running the binary
